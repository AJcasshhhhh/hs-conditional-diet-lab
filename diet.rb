# 1. Write a method called no_donuts that takes in a number of donuts as an argument. If the number of donuts is greater than zero then this method should return "Get back on your diet!" otherwise it should return "Good job, Homer!"



# 2. Homer's diet has been going well and we're going to cut him some slack. Write a new method called less_donuts that that takes in a number of donuts as an argument and tells Homer good job when he eats less than 3 donuts, to slow down if he's eaten exactly 3 donuts, and to get back on his diet if he eats more than 3 donuts.



# 3. We've decided to give Homer a little more control over his diet. Write a method called some_donuts that takes in two arguments - the number of donuts he has eaten and a maximum donut intake. This method should work similar to the method you wrote in #2, but it should tell Homer to slow down when he has eaten greater than or equal to half of his maximum donut intake.



# 4. Homer has decided to track both his donut intake and his cookie intake. Write a method called new_diet that takes in two arguments - number of donuts and number of cookies. If he eats 5 donuts OR 5 cookies it should tell him to slow down. If he eats 5 donuts AND 5 cookies it should tell him to get back on his diet.
